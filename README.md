# nanoFramework Drivers

A Set of Hardware Drivers made for [nanoFramework](https://github.com/nanoframework/Home)

## Warning
**The drivers in this repository have yet to be tested.**

Development of this will be reasonably slow, as I can only work on it for two days a week.

NuGet packages for the drivers are yet to be made available.
Each separate driver is meant to be its own NuGet package. (Also considering the inclusion of 'Shared', as I *think* otherwise it would be duplicated in the assemblies)

## Installation

Download the repository and add the projects to your solution by clicking
MySolution > Add > Existing Project on Visual Studio 2019

***or***

Install the desired NuGet packages (NOT YET AVAILABLE)
